    "**Preamble**",
    "As I sit here at 4:00 AM in the quiet hum of the ETHGlobal venue, I can’t help but ponder life a little bit. Just two weeks ago, I was exploring the beautiful gardens of Singapore. Yesterday, I walked across the Golden Gate Bridge for the first time. In three weeks, I’ll be roaming the streets of Bangkok. So much has happened these past few months, but it’s during still times like these that I can truly sit down and appreciate it all. Two years ago, I was holed up in my room, learning HTML and CSS for the first time. Back then, the most pressing thing in my life was doing well on my high school tests and exams. If you told me that in two years time, I’d be travelling the world, using those same HTML and CSS skills for one of the biggest web3 ecosystems in the world, I would have called you delusional. You’re telling me this dinky 18-year-old has the potential to meet some of the best engineering talent out there? Who, this kid who barely knows how to operate a MacBook, shipping code at that level?",
    "Grit is a crazy thing, truly. I used to get so demotivated back then. Why bother trying, when there are kids who’ve been programming since before they could walk? Monsters who could spin up apps in a few hours, fuelled only on RedBull and chips? The barrier to entry seemed so high. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that change is a gradual process. Most people aren’t born monsters; they become them over time. Just keep your head down and push through. We are all capable of such amazing things if only we commit to them. Before you know it, you could be working side-by-side with some of the very monsters you used to fear. Everyone learns at their own pace, you just have to find your rhythm.",
    "**The Work**",
    "That discovery came to me on May 28, 2024. I was in the middle of a nap when my phone buzzed with a Microsoft Outlook notification. Groggily, I sat up, only to see the words “ETHGlobal Offer” in the email header. In that instant, my world shifted—I let out a yell so loud it probably rattled my entire apartment. My hands were trembling, my head spinning. Being a software engineering intern at ETHGlobal has been a dream of mine since I discovered hackathons all those years ago. So many emotions welled up inside me during those few minutes; it’s a moment I wish I could relive.",
    "/ethglobal-tag.jpeg",
    "Enough emotional mumbo jumbo though—let’s talk about what happened after that dream came true. My ETHGlobal experience was nothing short of transformative. ETHGlobal is a web3 events startup made possible by 20 passionate people. As a 20-person startup, everyone has a big part to play, including the interns. I thought my time at Faire was impactful, but ETHGlobal takes autonomy to another level. From day one, I was shipping code alongside the rest of the engineering team. Everyone on the team is treated as equals, regardless of their prior experience. For example, in my first week, I had the chance to revamp the OTP auth system, modify the user database schema, and write OpenAI classification scripts. I got more work done that week than I ever had for any other internship combined.",
    "**Core Values**",
    "During my four months at ETHGlobal, I distilled our engineering team’s core values into three guiding principles:",
    "1. *Be a sponge: absorb*. You should constantly be trying to learn more about the codebase and technologies used at ETHGlobal. Look into how we model our schema and understand why we chose to use certain patterns. Read documentation and see how we implement things in our code. It’s not about memorizing everything; it’s about absorbing the *why* and *how* behind the work. Curiosity, when nurtured, unlocks endless opportunities for growth.",
    "2. *Unblock yourself asap*. You should never be stuck on something for a long time. If it’s a PR waiting for approval, start on your next task. If you’re lacking context on something, message someone who has it. And most importantly, if you ever run into an error, understand the error. Know why and how the error occurred. You don’t need to know how to solve it, but you must be able to describe what’s happening—visualizing the error in your head will help you pattern-match that error to similar ones in the future. Events are always right around the corner; you should never idle as an engineer.",
    "3. *Ship often, ship fast*. Don’t spend too much time obsessing over a PR. Build the primary functionality of the feature, put up a PR, and merge. If extended functionality is required, build that and merge. If bugs come up, fix them asap. Feature requests are very common and constantly changing scope. As an engineer, be ready to iterate, iterate, iterate.",
    "I think the biggest adjustment I had to make was recognizing that I was a core engineer on the team. If I am assigned a task, I have to own it. The expectation is for me to understand the problem (or fix it if already scoped) and then implement a solution quickly. The deadlines are strict and debugging should be done independently, relying on my engineering manager only when necessary. There is no one-on-one mentor to lean on—you must be able to carry your own weight from the get-go. This is made all the more important when we’re travelling. Over the course of four months, I traveled to three countries, helping organize three main events and six side events. If one of my features/fixes borks our software during the events themselves, it’s completely on me. Our entire team is relying on and expecting me to be able to fix it. You might think that kind of responsibility is earned gradually throughout an internship. Not at ETHGlobal. There’s no time for a slow ramp-up. My first event? Just two weeks after I joined. Singapore was first up, and I had to hit the ground running.",
    "**ETHGlobal Singapore**",
    "ETHGlobal Singapore was the first time I was able to meet most of the team in person and witness the company operate as one cohesive unit. As a hackathon organizer myself, it was super cool seeing how methodical and efficient ETHGlobal hackathons were run. During the event, I spent most of my time at registration, setting up printers, NFC scanners, and laptops. The engineering team primarily takes on IT support roles during the events, so I had a bit of downtime to wander and soak in the atmosphere. And what an atmosphere it was. The venue blew me away as soon as I entered. Nestled within one of the largest luxury shopping malls in Asia, we were located inside Sands Expo, boasting panoramic views of Singapore’s iconic Gardens by the Bay. Inside, it felt like stepping into a palace, with golden pillars stretching skyward, shimmering in the light. Security guards lined the entrance, overseeing a space with breathtaking views of the skyline. This was by far the fanciest hackathon venue I’ve ever seen.",
    "/singapore-bg.jpeg",
    "I was also blown away by ETHGlobal’s logistical work. Despite having only a dozen or so volunteers—hundreds fewer than in an event like Hack the North—everything ran seamlessly, perhaps even more so. I guess this is a testament to the experience they’ve built from hosting 10 events a year.",
    "Singapore was a blast. Although I spent most of my time working, I was able to sightsee a bit, too. Our team hit up two hawker centres, many malls, and even watched the Singapore Grand Prix live!! There wasn’t much time to soak it all in, though. Barely two weeks later, I found myself boarding a plane to San Francisco, preparing for the next event.",
    "/singapore.jpeg",
    "**ETHGlobal San Francisco**",
    "ETHGlobal San Francisco was held at the stunning Palace of Fine Arts. Overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, the setting was nothing short of magical. The pathway leading to the event doors felt almost surreal, with a circular garden embracing a serene lake, framed by towering statues at every corner. Stepping inside, the venue shifted to a cavernous, warehouse-like space filled with hacking zones and sponsor booths sprawled across the building.",
    "/sf-bg.jpeg",
    "Leading up to ETHGlobal San Francisco, I was tasked with upgrading part of the judge's scoresheet UI. One of the key features I worked on was a judging timer designed to help judges and volunteers coordinate presentations more effectively. The plan was to ship and monitor this feature on Sunday morning to ensure all goes smoothly. I had merged most of the backend changes prior to this weekend, but there was still a lot of frontend left to be done. Thus, as the attendees immersed themselves in their 48-hour hacking marathons, I also spent it grinding alongside them to finish my project. After pulling an all-nighter Saturday night, I was able to merge all the components for the judging scoresheet. However, a logistical hiccup prevented the judges from using the feature during the event. I did, however, get the chance to talk to a few judges after the event and get their opinions on my new feature, noting down any feedback they provided. This feedback helped me iterate and ship the feature in time for the last hackathon of my internship, all the way in Bangkok.",
    "/sf.jpeg",
    "**ETHGlobal Bangkok**",
    "ETHGlobal Bangkok took place alongside another massive event in the Ethereum ecosystem: Devcon 2024. Both events were held at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center (QNSCC), a monumental venue built by the Thai Ministry of Finance specifically for large-scale events. With 300,000 square meters of enclosed space, the interior is definitely grand. Although Devcon took up most of its seven floors, we managed to reserve an entire floor for ETHGlobal. As of 2024, ETHGlobal Bangkok was the largest event we had ever hosted, with over 2000 attendees and $750,000 in prizes.",
    "/bangkok-bg.jpeg",
    "But with scale comes complexity, and even the best-laid plans are vulnerable to hiccups. Within minutes of registration opening, our NFC scanners malfunctioned. Not long after, the printers began running out of rolls. As the flood of attendees continued, our hacker fast lane scanning system also broke down. To top it off, we didn’t have enough hands to manage both the hacking and sponsor registration booths. With all these errors coming to life, the engineering team was put to work right away. The first six hours of the event had all five of us interns running around fighting as many fires as we could. My job didn’t end there though. While I was running around fixing things, my engineering manager assigned me some bugs to look into that directly impacted the event. So, after registration calmed down, I locked myself in the staff room to fix these bugs. The worst was yet to come though. After wrapping up my work for the day, the logistics team announced that a few members of the engineering team have to stay behind tomorrow for a night shift. We needed a few people to stay back and monitor our tools and manage the help desk. So, I found myself adding the finishing touches to my judging feature longing for the light of the morning sun.",
    "That same Sunday, I had to onboard the volunteers and judges onto the new judging scoresheet UI. Although dreary and barely conscious, I dragged myself to the judging space. I spent the next six hours running around to each judging room, fixing any bugs that arose and ensuring the smoothest user experience I could provide. In the end, although there were a few bumps, our team mentioned how this was the best judging experience we’ve ever had. But honestly, at that moment, I couldn’t have cared less. After 24 hours of building and fixing, all I could think about was sleep.",
    "/bangkok.jpeg",
    "**Final Thoughts**",
    "Man, what a journey it’s been. Through all the ups and downs, I can definitely say this internship was one of a kind. Life-changing, even. Professionally, I enjoyed working with the ETHGlobal team. It’s so cool seeing people in their element, working under the same vision with their own unique strengths. Socially, it was so fun hanging out with the other interns. I had a blast exploring these three cities with all of them and I hope to explore many more with them in the future, whether it be with ETHGlobal or not.",

    "Searching for employment while only undergoing four months of university learning was an interesting experience. Especially given the mass layoffs and uncertain economy in the tech sector, I was definitely rattled.",
    "It was a combination of my non-existent (relevant) work experience and the above factors that pushed me to apply to ~100 companies. I heard back from three. Luckily for me, I got an offer from one. I coded quite a bit the summer prior and open-sourced all my projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Ezzhingy). A recruiter noticed this and reached out for an interview. I went through two interviews with that company before they gave me an offer.",

    "Civilia works a lot with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files, a collection of transit data that contains everything you could want to know about transportation. However, their main way of retrieving and filtering this data has been through the tech team itself; the management team doesn’t understand the intricacies well enough. Thus, there have been some efficiency issues with managing GTFS files. That’s where I come in!",
    "I was tasked with building a GTFS management tool, a file storage system that should be intuitive enough for either team to use, and which would effectively organize and display GTFS data on demand. Users should be able to upload a GTFS file to the tool, edit it, view its corresponding map and tables, and export it as a zip file.",
    "My employer gave me full ownership of this project. I had to scope out how to implement features, how to design the app, and how I wanted to build it.",
    "**The tool**",
    "I decided to build the app in *TypeScript*—having a statically typed language could prove super beneficial in the long run. I combined this with *Node.js* and *Express.js* on the backend, and *React*, *TailwindCSS* and *ChakraUI* on the frontend. I chose not to use a database, since I’d only be storing GTFS archive files, which felt slightly redundant. Instead, I’d have all the files sit in a separate folder. Unfortunately, no database meant I couldn’t leverage any ORM/ODM software. However, I still needed a medium to convert the GTFS files into digestible objects. Thus, I created a custom ORM/ODM-like tool to grapple with the GTFS data and allow me to filter it accordingly.",
    "I spent a lot of my time planning. This project had a lot of parts to it, so it was important for me to organize my thoughts. I also learned to pace myself. Four months for one project is a lot of time, so I had to properly manage my work to maintain good productivity throughout.",
    "By the end of my internship, I had built a fully functioning app that the Civilia team could use. With a few more changes, the team had voiced making the app accessible for public use as well!",

Aisles of cardboard booths strewn across the hall, students proudly presenting their rehearsed pitch to the crowd of people gathered around. This was our school’s annual design team fair, an event that happens once every term. I made a mental note to check it out sometime.",
    "In my second term, I found myself in the eng building once again. After learning about a few subteams, I turned my attention to a representative from *UWBlueprint*, a software design team dedicated to building technology for social good. I’ve previously done volunteer work for small non-profit organizations, and combined with my interest in computer science, seemed like a fitting opportunity. Unfortunately, this specific design team is known for having a super arduous application process. I didn’t care much for it though and applied regardless; what’s the worst that could happen? I wouldn’t know, since I successfully navigated through it (😋) and became a *software developer* and member of UWBlueprint.",
    "**Timeline**",
    "I worked extensively on the *Children’s Aid Society (CAS)* subteam within Blueprint from January 2023 to December 2023. CAS is an NPO that provides child protection services and we were helping build a platform for their *Supervised Access Program*. I started my first 8 months as a software developer, then moved up as a technical lead for my last 4 months.",
    "/cas.jpeg",
    "**First term**",
    "During my first term on CAS, our team consisted of 11 students: 1 technical lead with 6 developers and 1 product manager with 3 designers. Up to this point, I’ve only ever had experience creating side projects by myself with the occasional group hackathon, but I’d never coded under someone before and I definitely hadn’t worked in a group as large as CAS either. Essentially, this would be my first time operating in a software team environment.",
    "CAS is built upon a framework consisting of *PostgreSQL*, *Flask (Python)*, and *React (TypeScript)*. I was familiar with Flask and React (JavaScript), but not TypeScript or Postgres. Furthermore, *Docker* was used to run our application and standardize the local working environment for all devs, a platform (and concept) that was super foreign to me. To add icing on the cake, I was unfamiliar with version control in a collaborative setting; creating pull requests, dealing with merge conflicts, and git rebasing were all new material. There was a lot of learning to do.",
    "Since you can’t learn without getting your hands dirty, I dived right into the code. Once again, I was in far-off territory; the codebase was extremely large, with dozens of folders and even more files within—and this was just the frontend. It didn’t help that TypeScript has its own unique structure, one that resembles JavaScript enough for me to get the gist, but not enough for me to completely understand. It was like walking through a foggy day—a once amicable environment, now shrouded in an unfamiliar mist.",
    "Most of my tickets were frontend-related this term. This was a purposeful decision, since I wished to work with visual changes, hoping they would be easier to digest, and my tech lead happily obliged. A lot of my first few work sessions were spent badgering my lead with questions: `“How does prop drilling work with this component?”`, `“How do I use conditional rendering here?”`, `“Why does my branch have 100 commits; only two of them are mine??”`, the list goes on.",
    "However, with time I became more comfortable working in TypeScript and manipulating *Chakra UI* (a React-based design system) components for my own implementations. I learned about the agile methodology and how to pair program with other developers. Things were starting to fall into place.",
    "/bp-term1.jpeg",
    "**Second term**",
    "My goal this term was to familiarize myself with our backend. As such, many of my tickets were backend-focused. Once again, I kept up my onslaught of questions. Since I’ve worked with Flask in the past, I didn’t have to deal with the initial learning curve of syntax as I did with the frontend. I learned how to create class models, write validation in *DTOs*, implement *CRUD services*, and call them through endpoints. Inadvertently, this taught me how to use *Postman*, manage my local database history, and type terminal-based commands in *psql*. It was a really productive 4 months, and I began to understand how our app interacts through the many files found in both the backend and frontend.",

In addition, my prior tech lead had committed to an exchange program this term, thus taking on a more advisory role. It was time to step up.",
    "The responsibilities held by a technical lead were quite daunting. As a lead, you must understand the ins and outs of the project, from low-level implementation to high-level ideas. It is your job to break down the app into manageable tickets, assigning them to developers based on their preferences (stated in the 1:1s you conduct). Since you are working with an NPO, scheduling client meetings and implementing client feedback into your app is also a strict requirement. However, your most important responsibility is to be able to lead a team of developers and cultivate a vibey team culture 😁.",

It’s super cool seeing the designers think and talk amongst themselves—I definitely learned a thing or two about UI/UX from them.",

They help fill us in on any endpoints/subscriptions they create, any fields they update, and other mystical backend-y things.

They then convey this information to the frontend team, who calls the endpoint with the given parameters.",

For travel tool, this meant reaching out to: the *logistics DRI* to confirm bus locations, capacity, and times, the *backend DRIs* to ask about endpoint descriptions and field name changes, and the *design DRI* to hand off the Figma to the frontend team.

However, it can often be difficult for these businesses to know the best trajectory for their growth, with no streamlined method currently existing for gathering and analyzing their customers' feedback. SentiView aims to change that.",
    "Small businesses rely greatly on reviews; they tell them what they're doing right and what to improve. SentiView takes in a set of customer reviews and sorts positive reviews from neutral/negative reviews. Then, it finds the top five keywords that occur the most frequently in the review sets, helping business owners swiftly find the root of their problems.",
    "SentiView takes in a set of customer reviews and uses the power of sentiment analysis in order to determine whether or not they are positive or negative. Then, each review is tokenized and cleaned based on a stoplist. The 5 most common positive and negative words are then displayed to the user; they can then select and scroll through the reviews containing the word, gathering a first-hand view of their business's needs and strengths.",

Nearly one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness, but less than 20% of people actually seek mental health treatment. Furthermore, 47% of Americans believe that seeking therapy is a sign of weakness. Our goal with journal4me is to provide an outlet for people to speak their thoughts; to let it all out.",
    "Journal4me is a journaling app that removes the tediousness of typing out your thoughts. It is well known that journaling can improve one's mental health, but many stray away from the act, intimidated by the monotonous writing involved with jotting down one's feelings. With journal4me, all you need to do is speak! The app automatically processes your words and jots them down for you, so that you can rant about your day effortlessly without having to pause and think about how to spell a word or structure a sentence. At the end of your recording, the app even ranks your mood based on what was depicted from your rant using sentiment analysis!",
    "We developed the application's frontend using React. The backend used a FastAPI server that hosted the data generated from the Cohere and AssemblyAI API, which we used for sentiment analysis and speech-to-text. MongoDB was our database of choice, which we used to store our transcriptions.",
    "To level up journal4me, we could improve the UI to further better the user's journaling experience. Some examples include updating the text as the user speaks, adding a mood board, creating a larger 'emotion rating scale'; there are many improvements that we are considering of making in the future.",
